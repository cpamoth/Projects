DerekC: Improve binder file not found error messages.

DerekC: Fix SF958052: Intermediate class: inconsistent data types in Rows (keep
        strongly-typed data in row data).  Also fix SF1324248:  Candle doesn't
        require ExeCommand attrib.

DerekC: Fix bugs with the handling of BaseUri values for errors.

DerekC: Check for required/illegal tables for each output type.  This fixes
        SF1333004: Light failed while building msm, containing another msm and
        SF1314157: Check for illegal/required tables in linker.

DerekC: Add support for PatchCreation/@Codepage.

DerekC: Deprecate the src attribute.

        children of an extended element and WiX element from appearing in both
        places in the documentation.

DerekC: Move the serverca stuff into a wix extension.

DerekC: Fix several regressions related to the EnsureTable functionality.

DerekC: Add a new generate guids (gg) option to tallow.

DerekC: Cleanup several aspects of the sca extension:
        - start strongly signing it
        - put sca-specific error messages in a special messages.xml
        - change the name of the main entry class from ScaCompiler to
          ScaExtension

DerekC: Add support for multiple error/warning messages while merging modules.

DerekC: Prevent row creation in the compiler if an error previously occurred in
        order to avoid creating invalid rows (which now throws an exception due
        to increased row validation).

DerekC: Fix several bugs with script custom actions:
        SF1340394: Script function not optional for script custom actions
        SF1344829: Type 53/54 custom actions not supported

DerekC: Require the Feature/@Level attribute to be specified in the compiler to
        fix SF1342025: The Feature/@Level attribute is not correctly parsed.

DerekC: Move MergeMod functionality into its own namespace and NativeMethods.cs
        file (and cleanup some of the code).

DerekC: Fix a simple issue with a serverca error message.

JoeA: Add support for CustomActionRef.

DerekC: Allow users to override the default sequencing of sca and wca custom
        actions.

DerekC: Do not set the msidbFileAttributesPatchAdded attribute for PatchGroup
        since PatchWiz does this automatically.  This fixes:
        1346102: PatchGroup adds unexpected attribute

DerekC: Create binary sca.wixlib and wixca.wixlib files.

JRock: Added an "exedir" attribute to the wix NAnt tasks so that we can be
       explicit on which version of candle.exe, light.exe, and lit.exe we
       want to use to build.

DerekC: Run WiXCop on all wxs files in the wix project.

BobArnso: Update WixUI to use localization strings  -- you must now link with
          an appropriate .wxl file (WixUI_en-us.wxl included) -- add a 
          tutorial on using WixUI and fix SF:1280559.

JRock: The candle NAnt task now handles incremental building correctly by
       examining multiple wixobj outputs instead of just one.

JRock: Cleaned up the NAnt tasks for building native DLLs and EXEs by
       moving all of the logic to a central location (global.include)
       which can then be called from each build file. You can now build
       a native dll/exe with about 6-10 lines of code now where before
       it would take about 50 or so. Much cleaner.

RobMen: MSI SDK says ComPlus table has only one primary key, fix WiX tables.xml
        to agree.

RobMen: Improve ClickThrough setup.exe by adding support for ALLUSERs caching, 
        chaining of mulitple MSIs, and improved rollback handling.

RobMen: Allow ComponentGroups to be empty for those cases where <?if?>
        conditionalizes out all Components.

DerekC: Make XsdGen persisting DateTime data in a way that is compatible with
        the xsd dateTime simpleType.

SBonev: Fix regression where identifiers that are too long cause an error
        instead of a warning.

DerekC: Refactor the decompiler.

DerekC: Fix some bugs with the decompiler related to handling of temporary files
        and the MIME table.

JRock: Tweaked some directories in the NAnt build files in preparation for the

RobMen: Clean-up names of all WiX toolset executables.
        Add .config files for all WiX toolset executables to handle CLR 2.0.
        Add .manifest files for all WiX toolset executables to handle protected-
        admin on Windows Vista.

DerekC: Lots of random fixes and improvements for the decompiler.

DerekC: Fix decompilation of the Feature.Display column.

DerekC: Add support for decompiling the SelfReg table.

DerekC: Remove the generic extension message infrastructure.

ScotK: Fixing XmlFile table schema.
       Fixing XmlFile to support any lenght of ElementPath.
       Fixing CreateDatabase to actually fail if the user doesn't want to stomp
       the DB.

RobMen: Add support for MSI 4.0.

DerekC: Re-factor the extension interfaces/architecture in order to allow better
        sharing of information between the different extensions (table
        definitions can now be used by the decompiler and compiler extensions),
        add support for passing context information to compiler extensions
        while parsing extended elements, and in general just clean things up.

DerekC: Fix decompilation of localizable columns and a regression I recently
        introduced into wix.xsd because I didn't understand how localizable
        columns were persisted.

RobMen: Fix lang neutral .rc files to avoid #define collisions with standard
        Platform SDK headers.

DerekC: Support a shorter syntax for specifying wix extensions on the command
        line.

SBonev: Make PropertyRef extensible.

DerekC: Update all internal WiX extensions to the latest "standards".

DerekC: Lots of decompiler-related bug fixes:
        - warn when a table is decompiled as a custom table
        - Add decompiler support for the SecureObjects, ServiceConfig,
          ServiceControl, ServiceInstall, and XmlFile tables (and turn on the
          corresponding decompilation qtests)
        - Fix a canonicalization bug when extracting embedded cabinet files
        - Fix a dark and light bug related to showing the path to the temp
          working directory when binder or decompiler construction doesn't occur
        - Fix a problem with all extensions whereby each call to get a
          particular extension-type (like a CompilerExtension) would return a
          new instance of that extension instead of one
        - Move the User, UserGroup, and Group table definitions over to the
          sca extension where they belong (from the WiX core)
        - Setup the infrastructure for the ScaDecompiler extension
        - Rename the ScaExt project to ScaExtension to match other extensions
        - Fix an error message in the compilation of CustomTables
        - Remove unused code from the compilation of the ServiceInstall element
        - Fix a bug in the linker related to handing of null values in the
          CustomTable support

DerekC: Random decompiler and light fixes:
        - Fix decompilation of sequence tables when there are sequence number
          collisions
        - Read the dark option for suppressing relative action sequencing from
          the "sras" option instead of the "srs" option
        - Fix a decompilation bug with ensuring empty custom tables
        - Fix a binder bug with setting different compression levels on multiple
          cabinet files
        - Fix a binder bug with honoring the supress assemblies and suppress
          gathering file hash/version/language/size information options
        - Simplify the fix for the notidy option in light and dark
        - Implement decompilation for the ExecuteAction and InstallAdminPackage
          actions
        - Make the decompiler switch to absolute sequencing mode when it detects
          any action that will require absolute sequencing (this ensures that
          absolutely sequenced actions will always be in the proper locations
          in the final output).  In real usage, this means that the AppSearch
          action will often trigger absolute sequencing mode - but its better
          to be safe then try to minimize authoring

DerekC: Implement decompiler support for patch creation (pcp) files.

DerekC: Embed the serverca binary wixlib file inside its extension (and add the
        necessary functionality to the WiX toolset to support completely
        self-contained extensions).

DerekC: Stop nesting the Binary element inside the serverca schema and fix a
        recent regression with serverca error messages throwing an exception.

DerekC: Add decompiler support for the remaining merge module tables
        ModuleAdvtUISequence, ModuleConfiguration, ModuleDependency,
        ModuleIgnoreTable, and ModuleSubstitution.  Add compiler support for the
        ModuleIgnoreTable table.  Fix a bug in the compiler for parsing of the
        ModuleDependency table.

DerekC: Add support for hard-coding the Feature.Display column's value.  Don't
        allow features to be simultaneously nested under a Product element and
        another element since a feature can only have one parent feature (or
        none).

RGustin: Add MMC Snap-In registration extension.
         Move Compiler.GenerateIdentifier to CompilerCore.GenerateIdentifier
         to make it available to extensions.

RobMen: Allow MsiAssembly table to be suppressed using -sma switch to light.

BobArnso: Add back the ProgressText (ActionText) and Error loc strings;
          enabled their use by adding UIRef/@Id="WixUI_ErrorProgressText"
          to your source.

BobArnso: - Use whole sentences for localization, instead of building up 
            sentences by using properties to specify different verbs and word 
            forms, as many languages don't easily follow English word order.
          - Add ActionText/Template loc strings

ScotK: 4 ServerCA related fixes:
       - Fixing compiler support for rollback actions on SqlScript and
         SqlStrings.
       - Cleaning up usage of defines from Server CAs.
       - Adding support for RollbackOnReinstall support to compiler since CAs
         already supported it.
       - BREAKING CHANGE: Changed casing of ExecuteOnReInstall to 
         ExecuteOnReinstall for SqlScript and SqlString.

DerekC: - Add a Help decompiler extension.
        - Make HelpCollection/@Id required because the identifier generation
          logic was incorrect and unnecessary.
        - Change the help extension xsd file name to help.xsd to match other
          extensions.
        - Fix a bug in the XsdGen code for special xml characters in comments.
        - Add decompiler support for the remaining standard MSI tables.
        - Fix the help information for dark/light/lit/candle for new short
          extension syntax.
        - Lots of other random little fixes.

BobArnso: - Use whole sentences for localization, instead of building up 
            sentences by using properties to specify different verbs and word 
            forms, as many languages don't easily follow English word order.
          - Add ActionText/Template loc strings

BobArnso: Add build requirements to WiX.chm, fixing sfbug:1318424.

RobMen: Allow MIME to not be advertised independent of parent Extension.

BobArnso: - UI fails with 2803 if you click the enabled modify button in
            maintenance mode
          - Add ARPNOMODIFY to WixUI_Minimal
          - Adjust MaintenanceTypeDlg modify text/button based on ARPNOMODIFY
            setting

ScotK: Cleaning up server custom action memory allocation code and other stuff.

BobArnson: Fix WixTasks build to copy wix.targets to output tree

DerekC: Correctly modularize the RegLocator.Key and RemoveRegistry.Key columns.

DerekC: Cleanup wix.xsd:
        - Remove minOccurs="1" and maxOccurs="1" (since they are the defaults).
        - Remove unnecessary mixed="true".
        - Remove unnecessary sequence from under the Fragment element.

DerekC: Support grabbing binary registry keys in tallow.

SBonev: Modify candle.exe to not compile the input files if -p is specified.
        This behavior is consisent with the current C/C++ compilers.

DerekC: Fix invalid xml in a patching example inside wix.chm.

DerekC: Remove the entry section id from wixout files since it is not used.
        This is a breaking change to the wixout file format.

DerekC: Allow DocCompiler to correctly generate documentation for a deprecated
        element which does not specify a replacement element.

RobMen: Add FeatureGroup and allow deeply nested FeatureGroups and 
        ComponentGroups.

SBonev: Modify the PreprocessorExtension to work with an XmlDocument instead of
        text.

DerekC: Deprecate the FragmentRef element and support UIRef under UI.

SBonev: Move CompilerCore.GetSourceLineNumbers to Preprocessor and make it
        static. Logically, this is a better place for it because the ln
        processing instructions are generated by the preprocessor.
        This also allows consumers other than compiler extensions, for example
        preprocessor extensions, to determine the source information for a
        given XmlNode.

EdYoung: Change the compiler so that if a user specifies a multistring registry
         key, they actually get one, even if they only provide one or zero
         values to put in the value.

BobArnso: Added instructions in "Building WiX" .CHM topic on modifying 
          NAnt.exe.config to support .NET Framework 2.0.

DerekC: Fix 2 bugs with registry identifier generation:
        1. Registry keys may unintentionally collide if they share similar key
           and name values.  For example a registry entry with a key ending with
           "EndOfKey" and name "Name" may collide with another entry with a key
           ending with "End" and name "OfKeyName".  The problem is that the
           hashing algorithm does not insert a separator between the parts of
           the registry entry before hashing them.
        2. Registry keys generated by COM registration will not appropriately
           collide with entries authored via Registry elements (if they should
           collide because they have identical component, root, key, and name
           values which differ only by case of the key or name).  Before hashing
           the parts of the registry entry for Registry elements, the key and
           name parts were lowercased to ensure proper canonicalization.
           Unfortunately, the code for the COM elements like Class and ProgId
           did not canonicalize properly, so the identifier for two registry
           entries that are essentially identical may not collide (and thus
           provide the user with early feedback that an authoring error has
           occurred).

RobMen: SFBUG:1423648 - Create reference from WebDirProperties/@AnonymousUser

DerekC: Fix a bug with duplicate section symbols (like two fragment with the
        same Id).

DerekC: SFBUG:1427916 - Fix poor RemoveFile error message.

DerekC: Two decompiler bugs:
        1. Properly handle special sequence actions.
        2. Handle registry value of "[~]".

BobArnso: - Add WixUI_InstallDir dialog set
            (welcome > install dir > progress > finish)
          - Move dialog UI sequences out of WixUI_Common and into the dialogs
            themselves so custom sets can replace everything
          - Build a single wixui.wixlib instead of several separate .wixlibs
            (breaking change -- projects must now reference a particular
            WixUI set name)
          - Fix sfbug:1425869 (Controls extend beyond boundaries)

DerekC: Require the RemoveFile/@Name attribute since RemoveFolder should cover
        the same functionality.

BobArnso: To reduce localization effort, refactor common text (e.g., "Next" 
          and "Cancel") to use global loc strings rather than dialog-specific 
          loc strings.

JRock: Cleaning up the RegisterVotive.bat file so that it doesn't need
       grep or sed.

BobArnso: Add an explicit check for prerequisites like .NET 1.1 SDK.

DerekC: Complete support for short file name generation by implementing support
        for IniFile, IniFileSearch, RemoveFile, and FileSearch.

BobArnso: Make the WiX binaries a visible feature in Votive setup.

DerekC: Fix a break related to recent localization changes which prevent
        unreal rows (not tables from being dropped in output).
        This issue only affects users of the wixout format.

DerekC: Add support for fragmenting dark output via the brand new WiX Mutator.

DerekC: Actually add support for fragmenting dark output.

RobMen: Fix regression where Registry elements were no longer being picked as
        potential KeyPaths.

SBonev: Enable compiler extensions to nest under other compiler extensions.

DerekC: Reorganize IIS functionality into WixIIsExtension.

BobArnso: Update WixUI:
          - Add MsiRMFilesInUse dialog for Restart Manager support on Windows 
            Vista (verified with build 5342)
          - Corrected size of bitmaps to avoid resize distortion

         a reference to InstallExecuteSequence/RemoveExistingProducts

SteveWo: Add -indent:<n> option to WiXCop to override default indentation
         multiple of 2

JRock: Massive Votive rework and bug fixing. This brings Votive to the most
       stable release to date. Extensive testing was done on both Visual
       Studio 2003 and 2005. Also, some new features were added.

       - SFBUG:1176499 - double clicking on the file gives error
       - SFBUG:1124165 - "The parameter is incorrect"
       - Feature       - Added an optional RelativeIntermediateDirectory
                         attribute to the <Configuration> section of the wixproj
                         file. This allows for a directory to put the .wixobj
                         files so they aren't in the same directory as the
                         project output. Existing .wixproj files are still valid
                         without this attribute.
       - Feature       - Added support for the -loc flag for light.exe. All of
                         the .wxl files in the project will be used in the link
                         phase.
       - Feature       - Incremental build now works!! Also, the Clean, Build,
                         and Rebuild menu items work for WiX projects in both
                         VS 2003 and VS 2005. Interesting note, VS 2005 changed
                         the way it builds projects by adding support for
                         querying for project up-to-date status. In my
                         implementation of the interface, I was returning S_OK,
                         which indicates that the project is up-to-date and
                         doesn't need to be rebuilt. Consequently, VS never
                         called into me to build. It turns out that I have to
                         actually return E_FAIL to indicate that the project is
                         out of date. How in the heck am I supposed to know
                         that!! It's not documented anywhere. I only found out
                         by looking at the CPP hierarchy project that ships with
                         the SDK. Go figure.

DerekC: Use the proper file names for *.exe.config files in Votive setup.

BobArnso: Add -NXCOMPAT, -SafeSEH, and -hotpatch switches for all C++ projects

DerekC: Support the Control/@Sorted attribute in the decompiler.

JRock: - SFBUG:1350404 - Deleting Wix Reference deletes the underlining Wixlib
         file
       - SFBUG:1237769 - References in votive

DerekC: Update the Votive templates to be simplier and to use more noticable
        placeholder text.

DerekC: Heat.exe - setup made easier.

JRock: - SFBUG:1244659 - Assertion Failed: The collection is read-only
       - SFBUG:1221801 - If project does not load, context menu is wrong.

DerekC: Add preliminary support for harvesting websites.

DerekC: Add a warning for when a source file is being compiled with placeholder
        values.  This supports recent Votive and Heat work.

Chilbert: Fix a bug where formatted registry keys caused a failure in the
          SecureObject custom action.  Couldn't set permissions on the
          registry key.  Just needed to format the data that is pulled from
          the Registry table.  Also fixed aclutil.cpp so that CREATOR OWNER
          common sid actually sets up the appropriate ACL

DerekC: Rename extension classes from *CompilerExtension to *Compiler.  Also,
        rename the VS projects for the extensions so that they will all be
        grouped at the bottom of the WiX solution (this also makes their name
        consistent with the name of the assembly they create).

DerekC: SFBUG:1432723 - RemoveFile wildcards not accepted

BobArnso: Deliver PDB and source .zips as well as binaries

DerekC: - Move remaining sca extension functionality into the sql and utility
          extensions.
        - Move XmlFile, ServiceConfig, and Permission (SecureObjects-support)
          from the core code into the utility extension.
        - Fix a bug that occurs when an xmlns attribute appears on a Permission
          element.

DerekC: - Complete unique identifier generation support for the WixIIsExtension
          using a new IdentifierGenerator class for Mutators.
        - Parse the Module/@Id attribute as an identifier.
        - Fix a recently introduced bug with using the WebDirProperties element
          as a direct child of the WebDir element.
        - Simplify output for single file harvesting with -sfrag on.
        - Implement proper error support for harvesting a non-existant web site.
        - SFBUG:1459930 - Previous error breaks TabSkip support

BobArnso: Fix ICE validation in Votive.msi and WixUI qtests

DerekC: - SFBUG:1467438 - Warn when no UpgradeCode is present

RobMen: Fix PatchSequence/@Supersede to match MSI SDK

DerekC: SFBUG:1343841 - Illegal use of namespaces, results to name conflict

DerekC: - SFBUG:1215907 - Add support for MSI validation to light
        - Create a new tool called smoke.exe which can run MSI validation
          directly on any msi/msm files.

DerekC: Remove some unused code in the ParseCopyFileElement method and fix an
        uncaught exception that may occur if CompilerCore.AddValidReference is
        called with an empty string symbol.

DerekC: Move DIFxApp functionality into the WixDifxAppExtension.

JRock: Added property page support for WiX projects! Only one page is
       implemented right now. More to come. It only works in VS 2005,
       however. This is probably the start of a VS 2003/2005 separation. I've
       been running into too many little discrepancies that is really draining
       my time and it's getting too cumbersome to support two different versions
       of Visual Studio simultaneously since testing has to be done twice. The
       code base between the two versions is still identical, however, and will
       probably continue to be so as long as its feasible.

SteveWo: SFBUG:1470445 - Warning for formatted value in Property.Value

DerekC: - SFBUG:1328846 - heat should replace local file paths with file tokens
        - Complete implementation for harvesting a simple web site and verify
          that it passes validation and installs.

SteveWo: Update tools to use 4 space indentation and fix some wix sources that
         haven't been run through wixcop yet.

SteveWo: Convert all WiX 3.0 files to 4-space indentation.

SteveWo: Convert all WiX xml files to 4-space indentation.

RobMen: Fix race condition when multiple processes build cabinets at the same
        time.

DerekC: Convert all WiX C++ files to 4-space indentation.

BobArnso: Change zipping to zip explicit file extensions rather than whole
          trees. That lets us build WiX using WiX.sln (which puts the binaries
          relative to the source) without cluttering up the sources .zip file.

DerekC: - SFBUG:1467423 - Deprecate the Property element under an Upgrade
          element
        - Display an error for an Upgrade/@Property value which is not uppercase
          (required for specifying a public property).
        - Display an error if neither Upgrade/@Minimum nor Upgrade/@Maximum has
          been specified; at least one is always required.
        - Parse the Upgrade/@Property attribute as an identifier.
        - Stop generating a property for Upgrade entries (since it doesn't work
          for more than one) and instead require a property to be specified for
          each Upgrade element.

DerekC: - Display an error for feature names which are longer than 38 characters
          in length (this is apparently a limitation in Windows Installer).
        - Display an error for binary custom columns which do not specify the
          binary category for their validation information.
        - Display an error for root feature which have the follow parent
          attribute set.
        - Update some of the WiX unit tests to pass MSI validation.

DerekC: - Enforce the ICE81 rule of only allowing external cabinets to be signed
        - Only allow a DigitalSignature element below a Media element for a
          cabinet (versus some external files).
        - Create empty cabinets (previously they did not get created), but warn
          the user that the cabinet is empty.
        - Fix a possible namespace collision issue between cabinets with the
          same embedded and external file names (for example product.cab for an
          external cabinet and #product.cab for an embedded cabinet).

DerekC: - Create a reference for the RadioButtonGroup/@Property attribute.
        - Create a reference to the Binary table for Icon controls.
        - SFBUG:1474948 - References should have source line information
        - Properly modularize the Control.Text column for Bitmap and Icon
          controls.

DerekC: - Always use full paths in the harvesters.  This fixes a bug with
          harvesting a single file from a relatively specified path and then
          resolving paths to that file in harvested registry values.
DerekC: - SFBUG:1474943 - Modularize before working with files and streams -
          this change basically fixes a bug with no source line information for
          validation errors/warnings in merge modules.

DerekC: Fix validation errors in the WiX unit tests.

DerekC: Change WixQTest to always run MSI validation on single tests (but not in
        batch mode because it takes too long).

DerekC: Implement support in Dark for several previously unsupported Control
        element attributes.

RobMen: Support ignoring failures from packages during chaining.

BobArnso: Don't include .cub files in the sources .zip file

DerekC: Various FxCop fixes.

DerekC: Fix portability issues reported by FxCop.

BobArnso: Fix WixUI loc bugs by resizing various text fields: 
          SFBUG:1469187, SFBUG:1469191, SFBUG:1469194

BobArnso: Skip strong-name-verification-skipping if the pubic-key token is
          already listed (so once it's listed, the build runs as a normal,
          limited user rather than requiring admin rights).

DerekC: Refactor the functionality in the Common class into more appropriate
        locations.

DerekC: Create the WiX Visual Studio extension.

DerekC: Properly handle decompilation of null ControlEvent.Ordering values.

RobMen: First draft of support for CloseApplication element to detect 
        running applications and have them shutdown or require a reboot.

DerekC: Deprecate the Registry element in favor of more strongly-typed
        alternatives.

DerekC: SFBUG:1468990 - Bad linker error when linnking with extension's wixlib

DerekC: Merging fixes:
        - SFBUG:1446323 - Conflict using MSMs and Suppress Sequence Tables
        - SFBUG:1467421 - Merge errors should be ignored for the _Validation
          table
        - Suppression of an individual action from an already suppressed table
          results in an uncaught exception.

BobArnso: Updated WiX.chm with recent WixUI changes

BobArnso: Simplified binaries.zip layout to flatten the ca and ui trees

DerekC: Embed binaries in wixui.wixlib and make the necessary changes to the
        core tools to support this.

DerekC: Properly set the embedded resources in the Visual Studio projects for
        the extensions (so that they are debuggable).

MikeHo: Add Version number via -v switch to DocCompiler.

DerekC: Allow the Publish element under the UI element for defining the flow of
        modal dialogs more easily.

DerekC: Remove Tallow from 3.0 (it still exists in WiX 2.0).  Heat should now be
        used instead for 3.0.

DerekC: - Move WiX UI into a new extension called WixUIExtension.
        - Fix bugs in the linker and decompiler for extensions with an embedded
          library but no table definitions.

DerekC: Fix a bug with validation of short file names which prevents being able
        to author a filename that is less than 8 characters long with a 4
        character extension (like "tst.test").  Also catch illegal long file
        names which do not contain any non-period characters (like ".....").

DerekC: SFBUG:1485236 - Heat throws "System.Exception" if file ids go beyond 999
        - fix a few more FxCop warnings.

DerekC: Restrict the legal range of values for iis:CertificateRef/@Permissions
        to a ushort to prevent idt importation errors (because the column is
        only 2 bytes wide).

DerekC: Refactor the schema for patch sequencing to make it more strongly-typed.

DerekC: More FxCop fixes.

ScotK: SFBUG:1408130  Fix XmlFile crashes and add better error messages.

JRock: SFBUG:1476609 - Votive Can't Find Candle

RobMen: SFBUG:1448867 - update documentation to help explain a few more 
        SqlScript/SqlString options

ScotK: SFBUG:1473983 Fix WebCAs to not have hard coded buffer size for web sites

DerekC: Create the WiX unbinder.

DerekC: SFBUG:1491964 - LaunchConditions is not added to the InstallUISequence

RobMen: Add RegSearch for IIS version

DerekC: Display an error for missing WixLocalization/@Culture attribute when
        schema validation is suppressed.

DerekC: SFBUG:1490343 - Problem with MSM's and Light 3.0
        SFBUG:1487663 - Missing MergeRef causes ApplicationException

DerekC: - Prevent the WixUIExtension decompiler from removing rows from its
          library except in cases in which the database was explicitly built
          with the extension.
        - Use app.config for all configuration files so that they will work from
          within the Visual Studio project.
        - Create a standard interface for reading extension information from the
          configuration file.  This will be used by dark, heat, and smoke.
        - Make the WixVSExtension actually work by including the AssemblyInfo.cs
          file.
        - Stop passing extensions to dark since it now loads all the extensions
          by default.  This is done to ensure that dark will create the optimal
          output which takes into account all the available WiX extensions.
          Otherwise, authors would end up with a lot of custom tables and
          unnecessary registry keys (once we support more extensions which
          represent registry values in strongly-typed WiX extension elements).

DerekC: SFBUG:1490084 - WixUI should use standalone Publish elements

DerekC: SFBUG:1475370 - Tallow does not generate valid CodeBase registry entry

DerekC: The ListView.Value and ListView.Text columns should be formatted.

DerekC: SFBUG:1122555 - Support localization of control sizes and positions

DerekC: Properly handle read-only database files in smoke/Validator.

ScotK,AviPi: Use short paths for PerfMon to avoid localization issues with long
             paths.

DerekC: Fix a regression with the fix for read-only files in the validator.  Now
        the files are always marked writable instead of just flipping the read
        only bit (which turns out to be a bad thing to do most of the time).

a-TsunH: Add a print button to the EULA dialogs in WixUI.

jbae: - Move FileCopyHandler and FileMoveHandler out of the Binder and into
        BinderExtension so that extensions can implement their own copy and move
        operations.
      - Name changes for virtual methods in BinderExtension to follow the
        naming conventions of other extensions:
          FileResolutionHandler -> ResolveFile
          CabinetResolutionHandler -> ResolveCabinet

PMarcu: - Allowing extensions to define child elements of Binary elements.

PMarcu: - Making Installer Class public to expose the 2 public methods

DerekC: Remove the warning and verbose levels, explicitly assign error numbers.

PMarcu: - Temporarily treat feature names greater than 38 characters long as
          warnings instead of errors.

PMarcu: - Fix to allow Preprocessor object to be called multiple times
          while having the same variables defined. Before the fix it throws
          an exception.

DerekC: Fix a regression which prevented directory source names of "." from
        working.

DerekC: Make binder variable handling for streams actually work (again).  This
        should fix problems people have had with the WixUIExtension asking for
        files from hard-coded paths.

a-TsunH: Updated ProgressDlg.wxs to display title and text in minor upgrade.

SBonev: Fix to persist the "localizable" ColumnDefinition attribute properly.

DerekC: Stop using artificial localizednumber column.

DerekC: Create a PreprocessorCore for sharing information between the
        preprocessor and its extensions.

DerekC: Display proper error for missing ServiceControl/@Id and @Name.

DerekC: Add support for help functionality to the Visual Studio extension.

DerekC: Persist complex reference data as unreal tables.

DerekC: - SFBUG:1508611 - Unhandled Exception if directory to harvest does not
          exist
        - SFBUG:1493753 - Column Element : Category attribute incomplete
        - Remove the light -i option (it appears to be a bad idea) and create
          a callback for the binder extension to have more involvement in
          determining the layout paths for media entries.
        - Change TypeLib to default to non-advertised.

jbae: Add support for multi-threaded cabinet creation.

SBonev: Update cabinet dependency checking logic to use last write time instead
        of creation time.

DerekC: Re-factor cabinet creation logic.

DerekC: Better binder handling for files which cannot be found.

DerekC: SFBUG:1511706 - ODBCDriver fails in merge modules

BobArnso: Add SDK subdirectory to binaries .zip to include MsgGen and
          DocCompiler so you can build extensions without sources.
          Headers and libraries live there too.

RobMen: File/@DiskId now optional (defaults to 1)

SBonev: Add missing initalization of PreprocessorExtension.Core.

DerekC: - Support binary wixout files (for compatibility with 3.0 extensions).
        - Better error handling for cabbing and stream importing.
        - Fix bug when using WiX extensions from paths with spaces.

CuWaters: Updated Wix.chm Getting Started/First wxs File section to newest
          Wix schema

JohnLS: Fixed dependency bug in WixTasks. Added support for add single
        warning suppression in light task.  Improved error message when using 
        extensions using WixTasks.

DerekC: Support grabbing registry keys from .ocx files.

JohnLS: Fixed bug in NativeImage custom action when there are no GAC'd 
        assemblies.

DerekC: - Parse Property/@Id as an identifier
        - Handle inability to open a database in the decompiler (dark)
        - Decompile ControlEvent arguments correctly

DerekC: SFBUG:1519658 - MsiDriverPackages validation data is wrong

JRock: Moving WixTasks over to MSBuild in preparation for the big kahuna
       move of votive v3 over to MSBuild. Also changed the WixTasks so that
       the Lib task is part of the Compile.DerekC: More strictly parse some Shortcut attribute values.

BobArnso: Added extension .XSDs to binaries .zip

JRock: Fixed a couple of issues with the public builds related to the
       MSBuild stuff and WixTasks. Also fixed a couple of issues on the
       public build when trying to build from a path that has spaces in it.

DerekC: Change the xml namespace URI for WiX 3.0 since the xml schema is now
        different from the xml schema for WiX 2.0.

ScotK: Fixing crash in ConfigureIIs when it runs into a malformed WebSite in 
       the metabase.

DerekC: - SFBUG:1445483 - No support for Long Filenames in COM Registry entries
        - Fix several issues related to COM registration elements
        - Properly parse more identifier attribute values
        - Move the creation of simple references closer to the places in the
          compiler code where the attribute's value is parsed
        - Change the PerfCounter element to use the formatted string for long
          file names to reflect the fact that the short file name format of
          [!FileId] actually resolves to long file names outside of the Registry
          table

DerekC: Create new WixUnit testing tool (remove WixQTest).
        Also fixes SFBUG:1524184 - Null reference exception when using allow
        identical feature

DerekC: SFBUG:1501945 - Turn warning for illegally long feature names into an
        error

BobArnso: Move from properties to specify the wizard sequencing to using WiX
          v3's support for floating Publish elements. Each dialog set now
          publishes just the control events it needs to bridge the dialogs
          together.

DerekC: Warn users of the dangers of directly authoring the ProductID property.

DerekC: Expose strings in extensions to localization.

DerekC: SFBUG:1115450 - Support harvesting of type libraries

DerekC: SFBUG:1508965 - No ShortName for RemoveFile entry

DerekC: SFBUG:1505307 - Unhandled exception if file cannot be accessed

DerekC: Make some public methods internal-only.

DerekC: Allow SqlString to support arbitrarily long SQL queries.

DerekC: Parse more attributes as identifiers where appropriate.

DerekC: Lockdown wix.dll interfaces that were unintentionally made public.

DerekC: - Improve the error message for action collisions during merging.
        - Fix a bug with the outputs.xsd not having the proper declarations for
          the action xml.

DerekC: Add support for detecting the .NET Framework 3.0.

DerekC: Fix bugs found by running xsd fuzzing tools on candle.

DerekC: - Fix a bug with source information persisted in the intermediate files
          using the paths specified on the command line instead of full paths.
        - Fix handling of source paths in error and warning messages for the
          validator.
        - Fix bugs with validating multiple databases in a row using smoke.
        - Make light consistently use full path names.

DerekC: - Correct several incorrect forms of the null guid which may break merge
          modules from properly resolving feature links when merged.
        - Eliminate the need for feature backlinks.

DerekC: - Use an unreal table to persist simple references instead of xml.
        - Correctly parse several extension attributes as identifier values.

DerekC: - Stop creating symbols for tables which are never referenced.
        - Change symbol-generation tagging into a per-table option instead of a
          per-column option and always use a table's primary keys as its symbol
          columns.

DerekC: Created XsdStitch - a tool for combining extension schemas and a main
        schema so that Visual Studio IntelliSense works properly.

DerekC: - Replace custom xml for ignore modularization with entries in the new
          WixSuppressModularization table.
        - Change all xml schema namespaces to the new WiX 3.0 "2006" format.
        - Properly namespace all WiX-specific table names with the "Wix" prefix.
        - Break backwards-compatiblity with WiX 2.0 library files.

DerekC: Remove all unreal columns and simplify the wixout xml.

DerekC: Add support for later MSI 4.0 features.

DerekC: - Convert harvested COM registry keys into WiX COM elements.
        - Fix a bug with substituting directory paths into registry values
          during mutation where a parent directory of the correct directory may
          be substituted.  The fix is to look for longer directory path matches
          before shorter ones.
        - Add unit testing for Heat (to ensure we don't break it).
        - Capture the parent directory for an individual file harvest to ensure
          that directory paths are correctly substituted in harvested registry
          values.
        - Add back the RemoveReg unit test (I'm not sure why it was commented
          out in the first place).

DerekC: Truncate generated identifiers to 69 characters to prevent compiler
        warnings.

          literal output (which is useful for unit testing)
        - only unbind summary information values which exist

DerekC: Add a warning for hard-coded package codes.

BobArnso: Fix bug in WixUI_InstallDir so that SetTargetPath is called,
          updating child directories of WIXUI_INSTALLDIR. (Without it,
          only the one directory is updated; children retain the original
          structure as defined by the Directory table.)

DerekC: SFBUG:1548526 - Column/@Category="Template" changes to "Formatted"

DerekC: SFBUG:1548075 - Light crashes when not using cab's

DerekC: Capture self-reg info from .ax files.

       For a summary of the major changes, see my blog entry at
       http://blogs.msdn.com/jrock/archive/2006/07/18/670149.aspx.

DerekC: Fix handling of read-only files when unit testing transforms.

JRock: Fixed localization file (.wxl) handling in Votive so that files get
       added as an Embedded Resource instead of Content. Also, fixed the
       project template loading by changing ToolPath to WixToolPath, which
       is how it is referred to in the wix.targets MSBuild file.

JRock: Added special handling for PUT-MODULE-NAME-HERE in the Module
       element and PUT-APPLICATION-DIRECTORY-HERE in the Directory
       element. This is useful for Votive so that we have templates
       with placeholders. Eventually we need to come up with a generic way
       to tag attributes with a THIS-IS-NOT-VALID-BUT-EXPLAINS-WHAT-TO-DO
       type value.JRock: Integrated the Visual Studio SDK August 2006 CTP into Votive.

JRock: Removed support for SuppressAllWarnings in the Candle, Light, and
       Lit MSBuild tasks as well as from the Votive property pages.

JRock: Added support for making the property grid items non-bold in Votive.

JRock: When .wxi files that are part of the .wixproj are changed, incremental builds
       will not get triggered (MSBuild thinks the project is still up to date). This
       fixes the build so that when a .wxi file is changed (or any other <Content>
       file in the project), the project will build incrementally.

DerekC: Add a new tool called Torch for transform creation.

DerekC: Add a new tool called Pyro for patch creation.

DerekC: Add automatic component guid generation for single-file components.

DerekC: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish!

BobArnso: WixUI_Advanced
          - Draft of a two-click installer that also supports per-user/per-machine 
            choice and feature selection
          - This set is still in active development.
          - Future releases are likely to be incompatible.
          - Future releases are likely to be much easier to use.
          - Use at your own risk.

          WiX Setup - Provide a single .msi for all of the WiX toolset

BobArnso: This is really more of a feature request, but it has buggy 
          tendencies. Now disable the Repair and Remove buttons when 
          ARPNOREPAIR and ARPNOREMOVE are set.
          ****Note: This change has loc impact  new strings are required 
          to describe why the buttons are disabled.

                        multiple websites installed on the machine.

BobArnso: Fix sffeature:1566806 and sffeature:1557370 - Install schema files
          for VSExpress SKUs; add feature and dialog to describe when Votive
          can't be installed (lack of Standard Edition++ or 
          ProjectAggregator2.msi).

CuWaters: Added an error message that is thrown when an include file 
          references an extension namespace that is not provided in the 
          parent wix file.

RobMen: SFBUG:1608439 - fix "off by 2" memory corruption when using SQL

AaronSte: Updating devenv.exe /setup custom actions to contain Impersonate="no"
          so they will run correctly on Windows Vista.

JRock: Created a new managed FlattenXml project to replace the flattenxml.vbs
       VB script file. This is in preparation for moving some of the .NET 2.0
       projects to use the new FlattenXml.exe.

JRock: * Converting WixUnit to a .NET 2.0 project. In doing so, I added a new
       FlattenResources target which will automatically call FlattenXml on
       all project items marked with the EmbeddedFlattenedResource before
       embedding them in the assembly.
       
       * Added SD SCC support to the WixBuild project to get Visual Studio
       integration with SourceDepot.
       
       * Added the ability to test out the MSBuild wix.targets (.wixproj) files
       in test.bat. This will help keep regressions down with the MSBuild/Votive
       functionality.

MikeHo: Add support for UI transforms to the chainer

PMarcu: * Removing _Validation table from patches

        * Assigning the wixout that is passed to the binder to binder extensions.
        This wixout may be used by binder extensions to read in custom data
        provided in authoring to make decisions for any of the various binder
        extension points.

FreGro: Compiler switches modified to decrease output binary size for native modules.

AaronSte: Adding detection for .NET Framework 1.1 SP1, 2.0 SP1, Visual Studio
          2005 SP1 and Visual Studio 2005 Web Application Projects

FGrohn: No longer linking to BufferOverflowU.lib in order to comply with security guidlines.

JRock: * Added a bunch of extensibility points in wix.targets so that users
         can hook into different events during the build and perform custom
         actions. Here's the list of targets you can define in your .wixproj
         file to hook into the flow of events (in the order in which the
         events will happen):
         1  BeforeRebuild
         2  BeforeClean
         3  AfterClean
         4  BeforeBuild
         5  PreBuildEvent (this isn't a target, but rather a property that
            contains a command line to run)
         6  BeforeResolveReferences
         7  AfterResolveReferences
         8  BeforeCompileAndLink
         9  AfterCompileAndLink
         10 PostBuildEvent (like PreBuildEvent)
         11 AfterBuild
         12 AfterRebuild
       
       * Added a $(RunPostBuildEvent) property, which can have 4 values:
         - OnBuildSuccess: In this case, every step of the build must succeed
           for the post-build step to run.
         - <Blank>: This is the same as OnBuildSuccess.
         - OnOutputUpdated: In this case, the post-build step will run only
           if the main output was actually updated.
         - Always: The post-build step is always run
       * Added the ability to load custom .targets files before and after the
         wix.targets file has been processed. Simply define
         $(CustomBeforeWixTargets) and $(CustomAfterWixTargets) to point to
         your custom MSBuild files.
       * Added the ability to load a .targets file called
         $(MSBuildProjectFullPath).user. This is to match C#/VB project systems
         and I think it's because in some instances Visual Studio will create
         a .user file. I'm not sure when, but I added this for safe measure.
       * Added the standard IDE property macros, such as OutDir, ProjectName,
         ProjectPath, ProjectFileName, etc. These are useful when writing
         PreBuildEvent and PostBuildEvent command lines. It also sets the
         stage for the work to finish up project references in Votive (i.e.
         $(var.ReferencedProject.ProjectName)).
       * Added unit tests to tests.xml for all of the extensibility points.
       * Added a clean cache file, which keeps track of previous build outputs.
         This is so that the following scenario works: I build my .wixproj to
         create product.msi, change the name of my OutputName property to
         NewProduct and build again. The old product.msi will be deleted since
         I now detect that it is an "orphaned file."
       * Added a commented out section in the Votive project templates to
         bring attention to the BeforeBuild and AfterBuild extensibility
         points. This is similar to what the C# project templates do.
       * SFBUG:1644833 - change wix.targets to reference wixtasks.dll in local folder
         I added a property called $(WixTasksPath) that you can define to point
         to the path where the WixTasks.dll lives. Similarly I also defined
         $(WixTargetsPath) to point to where wix.targets lives.
       * SFBUG:1487283 - Light task fails when OutputFile not specified
       * SFFEATURE:1565305 - Pre- and Post-build events

PMarcu: Adding better argument handling and checking to torch. Also fixed various
        spots in the toolset that were crashing when using torch transforms to create
        mst's and msp's.

MikeHo: Add Setup.Exe, SetupBuilder.Exe, SetupBuilder.dll to wix3-binaries.zip

PMarcu: Adding method to make it easier to deal with references under patchfamily.
        Removing FragmentRef from under PatchFamily.

        Adding extension attributes to the VSExtension Refs

PMarcu: Adding UIRef and DirectoryRef to possible PatchFamily Children
        Allowing extension attributes on CustomAction elements.

JRock: Added support for setting pre- and post-build event command lines via a
       property page in Votive. This gets me one step closer to restoring the
       inter-project variables that we had in V2 but had to pull in V3 to get
       it out the door (e.g. $(var.MyProject.TargetPath)).

JRock: Added support for SolutionX variables in the wix.targets file. So, you
       can now use $(var.SolutionDir) in your .wxs files and have the variables
       automatically added to the preprocessor definitions when building with
       wix.targets and MSBuild.

Benxing: Regardless of differences in the MST, we will compare underlying files before
         copying data into the patch. Extensions can override CompareFiles to provide
         custom file diffing behavior.

AaronSte: Updating Heat to use HKCU instead of HKLM when harvesting registry 
          information on Windows Vista to avoid UAC issues

          on Windows Vista from an elevated cmd prompt.

PMarcu: Fix for DocCompiler to handle ref attributes in attribute definitions under
        elements.

BobArnso: Resize and combine some controls to better fit localized strings
          (affects all UI sets, dialogs UserExit, OutOfRbDiskDlg, OutOfDiskDlg)

Benxing:  Skipping unreal tables when binding transforms to improve patch build 
          perfomance.
          Adding active substorage into binder extension to give the ability to 
          access corresponding transform information.  

JRock: SFBUG:1673425 - Cannot access the VS menu using the alt key
       SFBUG:1576283 - Unable to enter 'c' or 'm' in proj properties screen fields 
       SFBUG:1570392 - Project Designer - Index was outside the bounds of the array

        keytable attribute defined on the column as keytable="". This results in
        an invalid table reference to "".

PMarcu: Switching order on Pyro commandline.

Jordanf: Adding support to WixUnit for Pyro. Fixing the qtest patch.minorupgrade
         to use Pyro.

BrianRe: Added code to detect a namespace prefix that is already in use and if

JRock: Adding back project references to Votive V3! Actually, I'm adding them
       to the wix.targets MSBuild file to be exact. Votive uses it, but you get
       the goodness without using Votive also. Basically, this is the feature
       where if you reference other projects in your Visual Studio solution,
       you can reference the output of those projects from within your wixproj
       project. For example, $(var.MyCSharpApp.TargetPath). This will work for
       any managed project in Visual Studio (at least it does for VC#, VB, and
       VC++ managed). You have to build from within Visual Studio or from the
       command line. If you build just the .wixproj, then you won't get the
       project variables defined.

JRock: SFBUG:1717966 - Solution Build Issues (build 2911)
         When a wixproj is the only thing in the solution, the SolutionX
         variables aren't defined when building within Visual Studio. This
         is because normally C#/VB define these variables for us. The fix
         is to define them ourself.
